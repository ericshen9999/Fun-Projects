I was not able to turn MCTS_Modified's rollout into an actual rollout since the code took too long to run. 
I was not able to identify the issue so instead I tried to modify the traverse. 
I managed to make it have a slight edge over MCTS_Vanilla when 100 nodes or more, but at around 100 nodes Vanilla still wins.
At 10 nodes however, the bots seem to be roughly even against each other.
